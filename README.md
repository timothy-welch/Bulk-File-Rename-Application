This is a small application written in Python to solve a tedious work problem, renaming files. 

This app has three core functions:
1. Adding custom numbering to the beginning or end of the file names by incorporating a starting number and steps: (i)  1. , 2. , 3. , ... (ii) 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... (iii) 2010, 2013, 2015, ....
2. Adding characters as a prefix or suffix (e.g. hka_)
3. Removing characters from the beginning or end

It also features two windows containing all of the filenames within the folder and another that specifies the selected files to be modified through an action. 
The files can be easily sent between windows and sorted through "Add"/"Remove", "Add All"/"Remove All", and "Move Up"/"Move Down" buttons. 

I hope this helps!
