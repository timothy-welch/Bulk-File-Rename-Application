This is a basic application written in Python using tkinter to solve a very common but tedious work problem - renaming files. 

This app has three core functions:
1. Adding custom numberingn pattern to file names by incorporating a starting number and steps: (i)  1. , 2. , 3. , ... (ii) 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... (iii) 2010, 2013, 2015, ....
2. Adding characters (e.g. hka_)
3. Removing characters

These three functions can be performed either on specific characters via a "Starting Character" widget or as Prefix/Suffix (by selecting 0 or 21 respectively).

The app also features two windows for ease of use: the first containing all filenames within the selected directory and another that shows the selected files to be modified via a selected action. The files can be easily transferred between windows using the "Add"/"Remove" and "Add All"/"Remove All" buttons. Furthermore, each list of files can be sorted numerically/alphabetically via a preconfigured "Sort" button or sorted individually via "Move Up"/"Move Down" buttons. 

I hope you find this helpful!
